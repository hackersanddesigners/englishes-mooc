Title: Nicoline van Harskamp:  The New International   Phonetic Alphabet School

----

Text: 

English serves as our current language during the Opening Days of [The New Alphabet](https://www.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/2019/das_neue_alphabet/das_neue_alphabet_start.php), but what do we want from our vehicular language in the future? And what do we want it to sound like? Phonetics are a volatile yet defining aspect of communication in multilingual contexts. A grasp of the workings of phonetics beyond the notion of “accent” is necessary to open vehicular languages up to a more progressive, empowering, and creative use. Artist Nicoline van Harskamp distributes a very short instruction video every day from January 9-13, that describes a specific aspect of phonetics that you will come across while communicating in English with people of many language backgrounds. Each day you will be asked to listen out to a single sound or tone, to analyze your own and other people’s use of it, and to try out different varieties. The International Phonetic Alphabet will be used as a tool: are you understood differently when you use an / ɹ / instead of an / r / or an / R /?
